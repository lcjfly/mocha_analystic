===============
### why mocha?

1. mocha is a type of espresso drink that combines coffee, foamed or steamed milk, and chocolate.
2. mocha is the name of my girl friend's doggie.

These two things are both my love.

===============
### what does it do?

I create this just for analyzing my blog site ( [http://lcjfly.jit.su](http://lcjfly.jit.su) ) with which i can know realtime activity , UV and PV.
It is cool, isn't it?

===============
### how?

I want this analyze tool to be loosely coupled which means not only my blog site can use it.

Your webapp can use it with '\<script src=jquery_path></script>'(some feature based on jquery) 

and '\<script src="the host of mocha_analystic"></script>'
